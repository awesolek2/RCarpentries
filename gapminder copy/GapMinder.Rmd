This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
gapminder <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/swcarpentry/r-novice-gapminder/gh-pages/_episodes_rmd/data/gapminder_data.csv")
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

```{r}
summary(gapminder$country)

#Learn ggplot
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r}
ggplot(data = gapminder, mapping = aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp)) + 
  geom_point()

```

```{r}
ggplot(data = gapminder, mapping = aes(x = year, y = lifeExp, by = country, color = continent)) + 
  geom_line() + 
  geom_point()

```

I want the points colored seperately
```{r}
ggplot(data = gapminder, mapping = aes(x = year, y = lifeExp, by = country)) + 
  geom_point(color = "red") +
  geom_line(mapping = aes(color = continent)) 
```


first example:
the data is skewed because of scale there are severl outliers that make the rest of the data difficult to interpret.
```{r}
library("ggplot2")
ggplot(data = gapminder, mapping = aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp)) + 
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) + scale_x_log10() + geom_smooth(method = "lm", size = 1.5)
  

```
challenge: modify the color and size of the points:

```{r}
ggplot(data = gapminder, mapping = aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp)) + 
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5, size = 1.5, color = "orange", shape = 17) + scale_x_log10() + geom_smooth(method = "lm", size = 1.5)
  
```


## Faceting 

I only want to look at the countries in the americas

```{r}
gap_facet <- gapminder %>%
  filter(continent == "Americas")%>%
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = year, y = lifeExp)) + 
  geom_line() +
  facet_wrap( ~ country) +
  labs(
    x = "Year",
    y = "Life Expectency",
    title = "Figure 1",
    color = "Continent"
  ) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1))
  
gap_facet
ggsave("gap_facet.jpg", gap_facet)
```


#Learning about Dplyr and Tidyverse

I want to know the average life expectancy by continent
```{r}
gapminder %>%
  group_by(continent) %>%
  summarize(avglife = mean(lifeExp))

```
I want to add a column to every row which has the average life expectancy of the continent for the country

```{r}
gap2 <- gapminder %>%
  group_by(continent, year) %>%
  mutate(avglifeContinent = mean(lifeExp, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  mutate(LifeExpBW = lifeExp > avglifeContinent)

```

I would like to see only european countries, only year, country, and gdpPercap


```{r}
gapminder%>%
  filter(continent == "Europe")%>%
  select(lifeExp, everything()) %>%
  arrange(country, desc(lifeExp))
```

for 2002, how many countries were in each continent?

```{r}
gapminder%>%
  filter(year == 2002)%>%
  group_by(continent) %>%
  summarise(count = n())
```
```{r}
gapminder %>%
  filter(year == 2002) %>%
  count(continent)
```

```{r}
gapminder %>%
  tabyl(country, continent)
```


```{r}
gapminder %>%
  clean_names()
```


I would like a portrait of life expectancy by continent, mean, mid, max, standard errror

```{r}
gapminder %>%
  group_by(continent) %>%
  summarize(mean_le = mean(lifeExp), 
            min_le = min(lifeExp),
            max_le = max(lifeExp),
            se_le = sd(lifeExp) / sqrt(n()))

```

I want to keep all of the data, but caculate GDP only for the people with a life expectancy greater than 25

```{r}
gapminder %>%
  mutate(gdp_billion = ifelse(lifeExp > 25, gdpPercap * pop / 10^9, NA)) %>%
  select(gdp_billion, everything())%>%
  arrange(lifeExp)

```
##Dplyr and ggplot

facet plot of all countries in europe, with GDP per capita by life expectancy

```{r}
gapminder %>%
  filter(continent == "Europe") %>%
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp)) +
  geom_point() + 
  facet_wrap(~ country)
```

##Joins

```{r}
library(nycflights13)
```

```{r}
flights
airlines

flights %>%
  select(flight, carrier,year, month, day)%>%
  left_join(airlines, by = c("carrier"))

```
